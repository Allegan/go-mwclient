go-mwclient
===========

go-mwclient is a library for interacting with the MediaWiki API. The package is
actually called "mwclient", but I chose to prefix the repository's name with
"go-" to avoid confusion with similarly named libraries.

::

    import "github.com/cgtdk/go-mwclient" // imports "mwclient"

This library is still under development (albeit it is sporadic), so do not
consider the API stable.

Documentation is available at: http://godoc.org/github.com/cgtdk/go-mwclient
